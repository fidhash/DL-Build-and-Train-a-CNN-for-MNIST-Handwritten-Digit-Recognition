# DL-Build-and-Train-a-CNN-for-MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. Using TensorFlow and Keras,created a deep learning model to classify these digits accurately. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation and plotting accuracy and loss graphs.
